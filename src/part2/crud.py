"""Create/read/update/delete operations over the in-memory product store.

Every operation takes the store -- a list of
:data:`~src.part2.storage.Product` tuples -- as its first argument and
works on it in place. The failure path never raises: the operation prints
an explanatory message to stdout and returns ``None``.

The identifier of a new product is derived from the store itself
(:func:`generate_product_id`): one past the greatest identifier in use, or
:data:`~src.part2.storage.PRODUCT_ID_MIN` when the store is empty.
Product names are kept unique -- :func:`create_product` refuses a name that
is already taken.
