"""Standalone helpers shared by the part4 storage and CRUD modules.

Normalisation:

* :func:`normalize_price` rounds a raw :class:`~decimal.Decimal` amount to
  the fixed number of fractional digits (:data:`PRICE_PRECISION`) that
  every stored price uses, keeping currency values free of binary
  floating-point error.
* :func:`normalize_product_name` strips surrounding whitespace from a
  product name, collapses every internal run of whitespace to a single
  space and lower-cases it, giving every stored name a single canonical
  form.

Presentation:

* :func:`get_storage_str_representation` renders the whole store as a
  text table meant to be printed to a terminal; each column is sized to
  the longest value it holds in that particular call.
